## Exploratory Analysis

### **Steps Taken and Findings**
*1. Identify data types*
  - Columns 1, 4, 5, 6 and 7 are floats while Columns 2 and 3 and integers
  
*2. Size of Dataset*
  - Dataset is very small with only 818 examples and 7 variables
  
*3. Check for missing values *

  - There are no missing values in Columns 1, 2, 3 and 4
  
  - 1.47% of Column 5 is missing
  
  - 74.8% of Columns 6 and 7 is missing
  
  
*4. Column Analysis*
  - There are 230 unique values in Column 1, 3 in Column 2, 12 in Column 3, 36 in Column 4 and 46 in Column 5. There are only 4 unique values for Columns 6 and 7       with the majority of their values missing.
  -
*4. Get statistical summary for each numerical variable*

*5. Derive correlation matrix between categorical and numerical variable*

*6. Further explore data pattern behind each correlation*
